          <h2>It all started with our kitty Conrad</h2>
          <p>Since the 90’s, we have always loved getting our kitties new toys, but Conrad got tired of them after the catnip went bad, and we wanted to change that.</p>

          <h2>Locally Grown Organic Catnip</h2>
          <p>We decided to start growing our own catnip in our backyard in 1999, and a local farm has helped us keep up with demand since our shop got more popular with the Saturday Market.</p>

          <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
          <p>We began selling in the Saturday Market in 2016 with the goal of providing locally grown, organic catnip toys that will last longer than any other toys your cat will ever have.</p>

          <h2>Reduce, Reuse Recycle!</h2>
          <p>To abide by our morals, and what many Portland businesses follow, we work with a local furniture store, which provides us with unused upholstery from new furniture, which we create the iconic “Upholstery Pillow” with! We are always happy to make personalized toys with any fabric you provide us as well.</p>

          <h2>Fun & Excitement</h2>
          <p>At the core, catnip is meant to enhance play time and engagement for cats. With that in mind, we are constantly striving to provide you the best catnip  possible at competitive prices. We don’t grow on as large of a scale as some big pet stores, so we are able to put more care into each harvest. </p>

          <h2>Where We Are Today</h2>
          <p>We still have the same values today that we had when we started in 1999. We want to provide our customers with the highest quality and longest-lasting cat toys on the market. All of our toys are handmade and our catnip is home-grown because we want them to have a personal touch. We can’t wait for you to shop with us!</p>
